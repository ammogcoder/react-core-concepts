# üöÄ React Core Concepts in a nutshell

React is a library for building user interfaces, composed of components. Components simply are just parts of a webpage. e.g. `header`,`navbar`, `sidebar`, `card`, `tab`, `footer` and so on. It is popular for building single page applications aka `SPA`

To begin working on react, lets install it first. Follow along these commands:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

### Folder structures

running `create-react-app` will make all the folders and files to start building react applications.

-   `my-app/public` - Don't worry about this one, its just contains the root html file. Here all the react code will be injected to the `<div id="root"></div>` of `index.html`.
-   `my-app/src` - this is the folder to work. `App.js` is the root component of a react application. You can create custom files and folders to make components. Some `.css` files are here to style the components.
-   Leave the rest as it is, don't rush you'll understand them yourself after sometime. Lets just say these files are very important and if you try to edit them you'll face unwanted circumstances.

Now edit `settings.json` to add magic on vscode, so that `emmet` will suggest to write `html` inside `.js` file which is known as `JSX`.

```
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "javascript": "javascriptreact",
}
```

## What are components ?

Its not rocket science to understand components üòâ, one of the core concepts of modern `frontend` developments/technologies such as - `angular, react, vue` etc.

These are the 4 ways to understand them:

1. Similar in pattern, different in look
2. Container and/or Root component
3. Single unit component
4. Mixed (mixes and matches other components)

## Create component and return HTML

Follow the these 2 basic steps to create hello world component.

1. Create a function, make it capitalize
2. Return a JSX from it

on `App.js` after `App()` ends, write this -

```javascript
function HelloWorld() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h3>Hello World!</h3>
		</div>
	);
}
```

Now you can use this component inside `App()` as this `<HelloWorld></HelloWorld>`.

you'll see `Hello World!` is showing on the browser.

## Pass data to a component as `props`

This `HelloWorld` component will always display `Hello World!` how many times you write it. To show different data `props` is used.

```javascript
function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<HelloWorld name='Hello World'></HelloWorld>
			<HelloWorld name='Hello Bangladesh'></HelloWorld>
		</div>
	);
}

function HelloWorld(props) {
	return (
		<div>
			<h3>{props.name}</h3>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

```
// Output:

Hello World
Hello Bangladesh
```

## Pass object to a component and access it

Lets get values for components from any object, rather than hard coding.

```javascript
function App() {
	const products = [
		{ name: "Photoshop", price: "$4.00" },
		{ name: "Figma", price: "$5.00" },
		{ name: "Sketch", price: "$6.00" },
	];

	return (
		<div>
			<Products
				name={products[0].name}
				price={products[0].price}></Products>
			<Products
				name={products[1].name}
				price={products[1].price}></Products>
		</div>
	);
}

function Products(props) {
	return (
		<div>
			<h3>
				Name: {props.name}, Price: {props.price}
			</h3>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

```
// Output:

Name: Photoshop, Price: $4.00
Name: Figma, Price: $5.00

```

## Create multiple components dynamically

We can't create component depending on data like this- `products[0]`. Because every time new element added we have to create a new component for it. lets make it dynamic depending on data.

```javascript
function App() {
	const products = [
		{ name: "Photoshop", price: "$4.00" },
		{ name: "Figma", price: "$5.00" },
		{ name: "Sketch", price: "$6.00" },
		{ name: "After Efects", price: "$26.00" },
		{ name: "Premier pro", price: "$96.00" },
	];

	return (
		<div>
			{products.map((item) => (
				<Products product={item} />
			))}
		</div>
	);
}

function Products(props) {
	return (
		<div>
			<h3>
				Name: {props.product.name}, Price: {props.product.price}
			</h3>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

```
// Output:

Name: Photoshop, Price: $4.00
Name: Figma, Price: $5.00
Name: Sketch, Price: $6.00
Name: After Efects, Price: $26.00
Name: After Efects, Price: $96.00

```

See, only this line is responsible for creating 5 components. why 5 ? because, `products` array has 5 objects.

```javascript
{
	products.map((item) => <Products product={item} />);
}
```

## Event, Component state, `setState()`, State hook

A Hook is a special function that lets you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

`const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`

[read more...](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<Counter />
		</div>
	);
}

function Counter() {
	// Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
	const handleIncrease = () => setCount(count + 1);
	const handleDecrease = () => setCount(count - 1);

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>
				Counter:
				<button onClick={handleDecrease}>-</button>
				<strong> {count} </strong>
				<button onClick={handleIncrease}>+</button>
			</h1>
		</div>
	);
}
export default App;
```

## Load data from API, `useEffect()`, Effect Hook

The Effect Hook lets you perform `side effects` in function components. e.g, data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components and son on.

[read more...](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<Users />
		</div>
	);
}

function Users() {
	const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
	useEffect(() => {
		fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
			.then((res) => res.json())
			.then((data) => setUsers(data));
	}, []);

	return (
		<div>
			<h3>Dynamic users: {users.length} </h3>
			<ul>
				{users.map((user) => (
					<li>
						{user.name}, <br />
						{user.phone},<br />
						{user.email}
					</li>
				))}
			</ul>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

## Virtual DOM, diff algorithm, react fiber

-   **‚ÄúDocument Object Model‚Äù** - The DOM in simple words represents the UI of your application,represented as a tree data structure. The changes and updates to the DOM are fast. But after the change, the updated element and it‚Äôs children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI. This makes DOM manipulation slower.

*   The **"virtual DOM"** is only a virtual representation of the DOM. Every time the state of our application changes, the virtual DOM gets updated instead of the real DOM. This updated DOM is then batch updated to the real DOM.

-   **"Diff algorithm"** - React follows the observable pattern and listens for _state changes_. When the state of a component changes, React updates the _virtual DOM_ tree. Once the virtual DOM has been updated, React then _compares_ the _current_ version of the virtual DOM with the _previous_ version of the virtual DOM. This process is called **‚Äúdiffing‚Äù**

-   **"React Fiber"** is an internal engine allows React to fine tune rendering to make sure the most important updates happen as soon as possible

Have fun, cheers! üçª
